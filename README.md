# Analysis of Various Telescopes Data 
Codes that I use for my astrophysics projects:

1. **BJDtoMJD**: This code converts BJD time to MJD time and is specifically designed for converting TESS time (BJD) to Fermi time (MJD).

2. **ExploreCleanCorr**: This script explores TESS data, especially focusing on weak signals. It cleans the data by removing negative flux values and calculates the correlation between signal data and background data.

3. **calVar**: This code calculates flux variability using a custom-made model.

4. **fitUL**: For a list of sources, this code identifies the best-fit model for estimating upper-limit flux values at different confidence levels.

5. **analyzeTimebin**: Using the FermiPy package, this script models the flux of a source and measures its average flux. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook visualizes the data for a single time bin.

6. **FluxVariability**: This script finds the correlation between flux and variability using data generated by the "analyzetimebin" code.
