Codes that I use for my astrophysics projects.

1-BJDtoMJD: converts bjd time to mjd time. This has been written to convert TESS time (BJD) to the Fermi time (MJD).

2- ExploreCleanCorr: explores the TESS data with weak signals and clean the data (remove the negative flux results) and find the correlation between the signal data and background data.

3- calVar: calculates the variability in flux using a custom-made model.

4-fitUL: For a list of sources, find the best fit model that can estimate the different confidence level upperlimit flux.
